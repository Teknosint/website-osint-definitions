            <h3>Why the OSINT Definitions Project?</h3>
            <p>
                My passion for research, especially OSINT research, led me to create the OSINT Definitions Project. During my master's studies,  
                I planned to write a research paper on OSINT. To ensure academic integrity, I included a small section the definition of OSINT.  
                However, as I read the literature, I discovered a striking lack of consensus. From Hatfield claiming there is no such thing as OSINT 
                to Steele declaring it a revolutionary force for democracy, the conflicting perspectives were overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
                This realisation shifted the focus of my paper to the absence of a clear definition of OSINT. After the writing, I still felt like the work was incomplete, 
                leading to this very project. <strong>What if we could compile all OSINT definitions in one place?</strong> Such a collection would help researchers track the 
                evolution and trends within the OSINT definitional sphere. This is the core aim of my project.
            </p>
                
            <h3>How can you use the OSINT Definitions Project?</h3>
            <p>
                This project is free for everyone to use! It can serve as a tool to track how OSINT definitions have evolved over time within 
                specific sectors, such as academia or professional practice. It can also be used to compare and evaluate the differences 
                between academic, practitioner, national, and international definitions. Furthermore, since the project includes a significant 
                number of academic articles on OSINT, it can act as a starting point for further research on related topics.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you use the OSINT Definitions Project in your work, <strong>please ensure to cite it properly.</strong> A suggested citation is: 
                Sechet, F. (2025) <i>OSINT Definitions Project</i>, URL. Additionally, if you create something based on this project, I would love to hear about it! Feel free to 
                send me an email at teknosint@gmail.comâ€”I'd be thrilled to read your work.

            <h3>What inspired this project?</h3>
            <p>
                The concept of collecting definitions on a specific topic is not entirely new. My approach is largely inspired by 
                <a href="http://www.organized-crime.de/organizedcrimedefinitions.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Klaus von Lampe's website</a>, 
                which compiles definitions of organized crime.
            </p>

            <h3>Where can you access the CSV file with all the definitions?</h3>
            <p>
                While the CSV file is not available for download on the website, I am happy to share it with researchers upon request. Feel free to 
                email me (teknosint@gmail.com), and I'll gladly provide it!

            <h1>About the Research Process</h1>
            
            <h3>How were definitions collected?</h3>
            <p>
                For academic sources, I began with the literature I was already familiar with from previous research. A key resource was 
                Ludo Block's <a href="https://www.blockint.nl/the-osint-library/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OSINT Library</a>, 
                the best collection of academic material on OSINT. From there, I followed references 
                and footnotes to identify additional articles and definitions. To ensure I covered as much ground as possible, I also searched 
                JSTOR for articles with "OSINT" or "Open Source Intelligence" in their titles. For each article I could access, I carefully read 
                the content to identify any clear definitions of OSINT. When a definition was found, I recorded it in an Excel file alongside 
                relevant details, such as the source, author, and date.
            </p>
            <p>
                For documents from national and international organisations, I either came across them while reviewing academic sources or 
                located them through advanced search filters on Google. These documents provided an institutional perspective on OSINT, which 
                was critical for broadening the scope of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                Definitions from OSINT practitioners were more subjective to collect, as they often came from companies or professionals actively 
                working in the field. I started by looking at companies I was already familiar with, then used targeted Google searches to expand 
                the list. A similar approach was applied to think tanks and media outlets. Apart from well-known contributions like Williams & Blum's 
                2018 article, many definitions were discovered through online searches and by tracing references in academic work.
            </p>
        
            <h3>How are definitions classified?</h3>
            <p>
                The collected definitions are organized into seven categories:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Academic:</strong> Definitions from journal articles or book chapters.</li>
                <li><strong>International Organizations:</strong> Definitions from entities operating at an international level.</li>
                <li><strong>National Organizations:</strong> Definitions from state or national-level organizations (e.g., ministries of defense).</li>
                <li><strong>Think Tanks:</strong> Definitions from research centers, even if not published in journals.</li>
                <li><strong>Media:</strong> Definitions from mainstream media outlets or newspapers.</li>
                <li><strong>OSINT Practitioners:</strong> Definitions from companies or professionals actively involved in OSINT.</li>
                <li><strong>Other:</strong> Definitions that do not fit into the above categories.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Given my reliance on academic sources and the tendency for OSINT definitions to be explicitly articulated in academic 
                literature, academic sources currently account for over 50% of the collected definitions.
            </p>
        
            <h3>What is displayed on the website?</h3>
            <p>
                The main page displays exact quotations of OSINT definitions. Clicking the right arrow next to a definition reveals 
                the full citation in APA format and the page number.
            </p>
            <p>
                When applicable, the collapsible section also mentions notes. These notes provide context to better understand the 
                quotation, the context in which it was written, or other valuable information related to the definition.
